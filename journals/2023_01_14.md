- #eda Some improvements
	- Partition: CDT?
		- Irregular triangular
		- Regular pattern? (triangle, rectangle...)
	- Via planning: flexible
		- Insert vias only, then move some
		- Insert both dummy and vias, then decide whether a dummy should be a via in the later stage
	- Capacity model:
		- Obtuse angle
		- Feasibility (Whether success in GR guarantees success in DR)
		- Back tracing (What happens before the via?)
	- Net order (in GR)
	- Congestion cost
	- Re-DT after GR (must-do)
	- DP order (in DR)
